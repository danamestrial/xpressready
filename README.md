# Xpressready

## Introduction
The project's scope is to implement a mobile application that uses the local APIs and must satisfy the chosen group of users. Our app is designed to be user-friendly, efficient, and capable of leading users down secure paths with the help of each local APIs we have selected.

Our app is designed to provide a solution for drivers who may face unexpected accidents on the road. We understand that most people panic in such situations and are often unsure of how to respond. By including all the necessary features and guidance, our app helps users remain calm and take appropriate action to avoid injury and reach their destination safely. With our app, users no longer have to worry about being unprepared for accidents while driving.

Our target users are users who own a car or usually take the expressway, and want to know how to deal with unexpected situations beforehand, they do not wish to panic during unexpected situations, and this included when users want to call someone for help (e.g. emergency contacts), they can save their contact details for easier access.

By using XPressReady, users can benefit from being informed about recent accidents before they begin their driving. This enables them to plan their routes more effectively and approach any potential accidents with a sense of calm and preparedness.

## Features
**For all users:**

Initially, we planned to restrict anonymous users from accessing certain features. However, given that this is an emergency app and everyone should have access to all helpful features at any time and place, we have decided to limit the access of anonymous users only to the profile page, where they cannot provide personal or vehicle information.
